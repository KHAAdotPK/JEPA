/// 
/// ## CHW (Channels, Height, Width) - **Recommended Default**

/// 
/// ## HWC (Height, Width, Channels) - **Interoperability Format**
/// - **Memory Layout**: Interleaved channels (R,G,B,R,G,B,...)
/// - **Use Cases**:
///   - OpenCV image processing operations

/*
    Tensor Shape Decision for JEPA
    ------------------------------
    CHW (Channel, Height, Width) format is chosen for the following reasons:
    1. **Consistency with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Most CNN architectures expect input in CHW format, making it easier to integrate with existing models and libraries.
    2. **Memory Efficiency**: CHW format can be more memory-efficient for certain operations, especially when dealing with large images and multiple channels.
    3. **Performance Optimization**: Many deep learning frameworks optimize operations for CHW format, leading to better performance during training and inference.
    4. **Flexibility**: CHW format allows for easier manipulation of image data, such as cropping or resizing, while maintaining the integrity of the channel information.
    5. **GPU Compatibility**: Most deep learning frameworks expect CHW for convolutional operations.
    6. **Standardization**: CHW is a widely accepted standard in the machine learning community, ensuring compatibility with various datasets and pre-trained models.
    7. **Batch Processing**: When you scale up, batch dimension becomes (batch, channels, height, width).
