# JEPA Implementation Plan in Rust - Enhanced Outline

This document expands on your initial plan, offering suggestions and considerations for each step to aid your JEPA implementation in Rust.

## 1. Image Processing and Data Loading

* **PNG Pixel Data Extraction:**
    * **Data Representation:** Decide on the `numrs::Tensor` shape for image data. Common choices are `(height, width, channels)` or `(channels, height, width)`. Standardize on a **`DType`** like `f32` for normalized pixel values.
    * **Normalization:** Clearly define the pixel value range for normalization (e.g., `[0.0, 1.0]` or `[-1.0, 1.0]`).
    * **Error Handling:** Ensure robust error handling for malformed or unsupported PNG files.
* **`data/transforms.rs`:**
    * **Essential Transformations:** Implement functions for:
        * **Resizing:** To a fixed input dimension for your neural networks.
        * **Normalization:** Based on your chosen range.
        * **Random Cropping:** Crucial for generating distinct **context** and **target** regions for JEPA.
        * **Random Flips (Horizontal/Vertical):** Common data augmentation to improve model generalization.
    * **Transform Pipelines:** Design a mechanism to compose these transformations, perhaps using a `TransformPipeline` struct or a `Box<dyn Transform>` trait.
* **Data Structures for Batching:**
    * Create a `Dataset` struct that can load images and apply transformations.
    * Implement an iterator or method (e.g., `batches()`) to yield batches of `(context_image_tensor, target_image_tensor)`.
    * Consider how to handle **padding** if images within a batch might have varying sizes (though typically, images are resized to a fixed dimension before batching).

## 2. Core JEPA Architecture Components

* **`numrs` Integration - Crucial Requirements:**
    * **`Layer` Trait:** Define a `Layer` trait in `numrs` that all neural network layers (e.g., `Conv2d`, `ReLU`, `Linear`) will implement. This allows for dynamic layer creation and network construction using `Vec<Box<dyn Layer>>`.
    * **Automatic Differentiation (Autograd):** This is the most complex but essential part. `numrs` must support:
        * **Computation Graph:** To track operations and their dependencies.
        * **Gradient Computation:** For each operation (e.g., matrix multiplication, convolution), its derivative must be defined.
        * **Gradient Accumulation:** To sum gradients through complex paths.
        * Methods like `loss.backward()` and `tensor.requires_grad()` imply this functionality.
    * **Optimizers:** Implement common optimization algorithms (e.g., `SGD`, `Adam`) that can update model parameters using computed gradients.
* **`ContextEncoder` / `TargetEncoder` (`model/encoder.rs`):**
    * **Architecture:** Define the specific layers within these encoders (e.g., `Conv2d` layers with `ReLU` activations, followed by pooling, and potentially a final `Linear` layer to produce the embedding).
    * **Shared Weights & EMA:** A common and powerful technique in JEPA is to have the `TargetEncoder`'s weights be an **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)** of the `ContextEncoder`'s weights.
        * Initially, the weights can be shared.
        * During training, after each `ContextEncoder` weight update, the `TargetEncoder`'s weights are softly updated: `target_weight = ema_decay * target_weight + (1 - ema_decay) * context_weight`.
        * This requires managing the `TargetEncoder`'s parameters separately and updating them in the training loop.
* **`Predictor` (`model/predictor.rs`):**
    * **Architecture:** This will likely be a simple **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** with a few `Linear` layers and activations.
    * **Input/Output Dimensions:** Its input dimension will be the `embedding_dim` from the `ContextEncoder`, and its output dimension will match the `embedding_dim` of the `TargetEncoder`.
* **`JEPAModel` (`model/jepa.rs`):**
    * **`JEPAConfig` Struct:** Define this to hold all model-specific hyperparameters (e.g., `input_image_size`, `embedding_dim`, `num_encoder_layers`, `num_predictor_layers`, `ema_decay`, etc.).
    * **Context/Target Region Generation:** The `forward` method or a helper function will be responsible for applying the masking/cropping logic to extract the context and target parts from the input image.
    * **Loss Function:** Implement the `compute_loss` method. A **contrastive loss** or **L2 distance** (Mean Squared Error) between the `predicted_embedding` and `true_target_embedding` is typical.

## 3. Training Loop (`utils/training.rs`)

* **Optimizer Integration:** Ensure your `Optimizer` struct/trait takes a mutable reference to the model's parameters.
* **Autograd Execution:** The lines `loss.backward()` and `optimizer.step()` heavily rely on `numrs` having a robust autograd system to compute and apply gradients.
* **Target Encoder Update (if using EMA):** If you opt for EMA for the target encoder, incorporate the EMA update step within the training loop, typically after the `optimizer.step()`.
* **Logging:** Beyond basic print statements, consider integrating a proper logging framework (e.g., `log` crate with a backend like `env_logger` or `tracing`) to track metrics like epoch loss, learning rate, and potentially gradient norms.

---

## 4. Evaluation and Visualization (`utils/training.rs` or `utils/evaluation.rs`)

* **Evaluation Metrics:** While loss is a primary metric, consider other evaluation strategies for self-supervised models. For example, if you later fine-tune the encoder on a downstream task, that performance would be the ultimate metric.
* **Visualization:**
    * **Reconstruction:** A powerful visualization is to attempt to reconstruct the *target image region* from the *predicted embedding*. This might require a small decoder network, but it directly shows what the model "predicts."
    * **Embedding Space Similarity:** Visualize the cosine similarity or L2 distance between the predicted embedding and the true target embedding for various examples.
    * **Input/Output Comparison:** Display the original image, the extracted context, the true target region, and the predicted reconstruction/embedding for qualitative analysis.

## Implementation Notes & Milestones

* **Tensor Operations:** All neural network operations (convolution, pooling, linear transformations, activations) must be implemented correctly in `numrs` with gradient support.
* **Embedding Approach:** The core idea is that the **context encoder** learns a representation of the visible parts, the **target encoder** learns a representation of the masked parts, and the **predictor** learns to map the context representation to the target representation.
* **Loss Function:** Choose a loss function appropriate for comparing embeddings. **Cosine similarity loss** (maximizing similarity) or **L2 distance** (minimizing difference) are good starting points.
* **Training Strategy:**
    * Start simple: Begin with small images and a very shallow network.
    * Iterative complexity: Gradually increase image resolution, network depth, and batch size as you verify each component's correctness.
    * Curriculum Learning (Optional): Begin with "easier" prediction tasks (e.g., smaller masks, simpler patterns) before moving to more complex ones.

### Suggested Milestones:

* **Milestone 1: Data Pipeline Operational.**
    * Load PNGs, extract pixels, apply resize/normalize transforms.
    * Generate valid context/target regions for a single image.
    * Batching mechanism is functional.
* **Milestone 2: `numrs` Foundation (Autograd & Layers).**
    * Core `Tensor` operations with working autograd.
    * Basic neural network layers (`Linear`, `Conv2d`, `ReLU`) with correct gradient computation.
    * An `Optimizer` implementation that can update parameters.
* **Milestone 3: Individual JEPA Components Functional.**
    * `ContextEncoder`, `TargetEncoder`, and `Predictor` can be instantiated and run a forward pass, producing correctly shaped outputs.
* **Milestone 4: Full JEPA Model & Basic Training.**
    * `JEPAModel` can be initialized and run a full forward pass.
    * A minimal training loop completes without errors, even if loss doesn't immediately decrease.
* **Milestone 5: End-to-End Training, Evaluation, and Visualization.**
    * The model trains on a small dataset, demonstrating a decrease in loss.
    * Evaluation metrics are tracked.
    * Basic visualization tools work to inspect model behavior.
